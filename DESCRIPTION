Description: Methods of homogenous segmentation for spatial lines data, such as pavement 
             performance indicators and traffic volumes. Three methods are available for 
             homogenous segmentation, including cumulative difference approach, minimization 
             coefficient of variation, and spatial heterogeneity based method.
